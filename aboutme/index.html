    <p>I am a Business Management-Marketing student here at BYU-Idaho, and I want to use it to become a freelance
        social media manager. I am taking this class in order to create more credibility and flexibility for my future
        career. I recently did an internship that helped me envision what this career may look like, and one of the
        things my boss wanted help with was creating a better website. However, I didn't have any experience with it and
        wanted to learn, so now I am minoring in Web Design.</p>
    <p>I love to do all things crafty such as painting and embroidery. I also love playing sports; in high school,
        participated in rubgy and softball. Now that I am older, it can be challenging to find time to do those sports I love. I am
        recently engaged to my high school
        sweetheart and will be getting married in October.</p>
