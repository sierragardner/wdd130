        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My fiance and I want to run a car detailing business together. He will be in charge of the operations, while
            I will be behind the scenes marketing for the business mainly through a website. The purpose of this website
            is to show customers the different services that are offered and how much they will cost. Additionally,
            customers would be able to schedule appointments through the website and find an FAQ page, all with the
            purpose of cutting out the hassle of having to call the business directly. The biggest issue that we have
            run into as a business is trying to keep appointments in line, so this will be a great solution to the
            question of how to make this run smoothly and with ease for both us and our customers. </p>

            This is the homepage that will grab attention of the users when first visiting it. We want people to see at
            first glance what services are offered and how we can best service them at BM Detailing. This homepage will
            have an overview of the best services available, what the prices points are, where they can set
            appointments, and be able to answer any questions that they may have for us. As of now, this business is
            only a mobile detailing service, so we want to be sure that customers are aware of that before they book an
            appointment with us.

            <b>What questions will this page answer?</b>
            This page is going to go over what each package detail will include. There are 3 options for the
            packages(Basic, Express, and Deluxe), and there will be options for add-on. Additionally, if they only want
            one thing done, such as only their seats shampooed, there are options for that. Prices will be on a case by
            case basis, so customers will have to request an appointment. Essentially, this page is going to be the meat
            of the whole website.

            always vary depending on the size of vehicle, what exact services you desire, where you live, etc. This is

            any questions that the customer may have. Through this appointment page, we will be able to complete the
